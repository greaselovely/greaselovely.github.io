Verse 1:
Shadows creep, heart's in flames
She said forever, but played her games
Loyalty's a joke, she never cared
Left me broken, soul laid bare

Chorus:
Can't stand the pain, it's driving me insane
Burning like the sun, stinging like the rain
Can't stand the pain, it's all that remains
Echoes of betrayal, pounding in my veins

Verse 2:
Bruises on my arm, a constant ache
Memories of trust I can't shake
Sunburned skin, peeling away
Just like the promises that wouldn't stay

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:
Numb myself, try to forget
But every touch is a bitter regret
Scorched by love, punched by fate
Can't escape this painful state

(Repeat Chorus)

Outro:
Can't stand the pain, can't stand the pain
It's all that remains, all that remains
